## **üß™ Test This Now:**

### **Step 1: Create a Category**
1. Go to: `http://localhost:8000/category/create/`
2. Login if needed
3. Create a test category (e.g., "Electronics")

### **Step 2: Create a Product with Category**
1. Go to: `http://localhost:8000/products/create/`
2. Fill in product details
3. **Look for the "Product Category" field** - it should now be visible!
4. Select your category from the dropdown
5. Save the product

### **Step 3: Verify Category Assignment**
1. Go to: `http://localhost:8000/products/`
2. Click on your category button

## **üîç What You Should See:**

### **In Product Create Form:**
```
Product Name: [Input field]
Product Description: [Textarea]
Product Category: [Dropdown with categories] ‚Üê **THIS WAS MISSING!**
Price: [Input field]
Items in Stock: [Input field]
Product Image: [File input]
```

### **In Product List:**
- Category filter buttons at the top
- Products organized by category
- Clicking a category shows only those products

---

## **üö® If Category Field Still Doesn't Show:**

### **Check These:**
1. **Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Server Restart**: Stop and restart the Django server
3. **Template Location**: Make sure you're editing the right file
4. **Form Fields**: Check that `category` is in the `fields` list in `ProductForm`

### **Debug Steps:**
1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Look at the page source to see if the field HTML is there
3. Verify the form is using the correct template

## **‚úÖ Expected Result:**

After this fix, you should be able to:
1. **See the category field** when creating/editing products
2. **Select categories** from a dropdown menu
3. **Filter products** by category
4. **Organize your products** logically

## **üéØ Quick Test:**

1. **Create Category**: "Test Category"
